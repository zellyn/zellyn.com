<p>Last night I lay thinking of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction">Continued Fractions</a>,
trying to understand not just the notation, but what they mean.</p>

<p>Trying to pull apart and unwind smaller and smaller parts of these
recurrent shapes gave way, as I fell asleep, to the same kind of
recursive unwinding, but of my own past.</p>

<p>I dreamed all night of scattered childhood memories. At one point,
remembering a song – or perhaps just the act of singing – I was
pierced with a flash of a long-forgotten feeling: that all is right
with the world, that Mum and Dad are in charge, that I am safe.</p>

<p>It’s amazing how profoundly we lose that feeling.</p>
