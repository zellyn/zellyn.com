      <description>In an effort to organize the many side-projects I would like to do &amp;mdash; at least in my mind &amp;amp;mdash but probably never will, I created a Projects: TODO page.
I&amp;rsquo;ve never collaborated much on side projects. If something strikes your fancy, I would love to work together.</description>

      <description>$$ 26 + \frac{1}{5 + \frac{1}{12 + \frac{1}{12 + \frac{1}{25 + \frac{1}{14 + \cdots}}}}} $$
Last night I lay thinking of Continued Fractions, trying to understand not just the notation, but what they mean.
Trying to pull apart and unwind smaller and smaller parts of these recurrent shapes gave way, as I fell asleep, to the same kind of recursive unwinding, but of my own past.
I dreamed all night of scattered childhood memories.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my new site. Iâ€™m just trying to get everything working: expect both style and substance later.
For now, my old site is probably more interesting.</description>

      <description>This is a list of side projects I would like to do.
I&amp;rsquo;m trying to create a structured list of next steps: hopefully that&amp;rsquo;ll make it easier to pick off tasks to work on, and (less likely) attract interest from others.
6502 Golf site comp.sys.apple2 folks sometimes like to collaborate/compete on golfing 6502 code. I thought it would be fun to create a site for 6502 golfing.
Leaderboards would be fun, and being able to track the tree of ideas (by giving credit or explicitly starting with code and modifying it) would be instructive.</description>
