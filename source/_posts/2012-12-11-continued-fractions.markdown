$$
26 + \frac{1}{5 + \frac{1}{12 + \frac{1}{12 + \frac{1}{25 + \frac{1}{14 + \cdots}}}}}
$$

Last night I lay thinking of
[Continued Fractions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction),
trying to understand not just the notation, but what they mean.

Trying to pull apart and unwind smaller and smaller parts of these
recurrent shapes gave way, as I fell asleep, to the same kind of
recursive unwinding, but of my own past.

I dreamed all night of scattered childhood memories. At one point,
remembering a song -- or perhaps just the act of singing -- I was
pierced with a flash of a long-forgotten feeling: that all is right
with the world, that Mum and Dad are in charge, that I am safe.

It's amazing how profoundly we lose that feeling.
